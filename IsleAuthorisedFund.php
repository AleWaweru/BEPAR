                    <h3>Isle of Man Authorised Scheme</h3>

                    <h4>Introduction </h4>

                    <p>Authorised Collective Investment Schemes ('Authorised CIS') are retail funds authorised by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority ('the Authority').</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Type A schemes are analogous to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “UCITS”; and</li>
                        <li> Type B schemes are schemes which are not limited to operating under investment and borrowing powers which are analogous to those under the UCITS directive, including funds of alternative investment funds “FAIFs”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Authorised funds are formally authorised and may be marketed to the general public in the Isle of Man. They are subject to prescriptive regulation: for example, the types of fund that are eligible for authorisation are prescribed - securities funds, money market funds, property funds, various derivatives funds, feeder funds, umbrella funds, etc.
                        Authorised schemes are retail-focused and may be sold directly to the general public in the Isle of Man and in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey and Ireland. Arrangements are also in place with Hong Kong, Australia and Japan. They benefit from an Isle of Man investor compensation scheme.
