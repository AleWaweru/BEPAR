                    <h3>Types/Categories of Companies</h3>

                    <p>The Companies Act 2001 provides for several types and categories of companies:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Domestic Company</li>
                        <p>A domestic company, also known as a local company, is an entity incorporated under the laws of Mauritius by the Registrar of Companies and governed by the Companies Act 2001, the Business Registration Act 2002, the Income Tax Act 1995, and the Value Added Tax Act, amongst other legislations.</p>
                        <p>A domestic company is used for conducting activities with Mauritius residents such as trading, consultancy services, investment holding, and acquisition of immovable property under the Property Development Scheme in Mauritius amongst others. A domestic company can also apply for a Freeport License for warehousing, transshipment and/or transformation of products in the Freeport Sector in Mauritius.</p>
                        <p>Features of a domestic company:</p>

                            <li>No minimum stated capital requirement</li>
                            <li>Minimum of one (1) resident director required</li>
                            <li>Minimum of one (1) shareholder required who can be a non-resident of Mauritius</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The rate of tax for a domestic company is 15% flat on its net profit.</p>
                        <p>A domestic company is not regulated by the Financial Services Commission unless it is operating in the financial services sector.</p>

                        <li>Global Business Company (GBC)</li>
                        <p>The Mauritius GBC can be set up with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A minimum capital of U$1</li>
                            <li>One shareholder</li>
                            <li>Two directors who must be be ordinarily residing in Mauritius</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Financial Services Commission also frequently requests additional evidence thahe company is managed from Mauritius, including a local corporate bank account.</p>
                        <p>The Mauritius GBC can trade can trade with locals after prior approval from the Mauritius FSP. It is also allowed to provide financial insurance seovided a license has been granted by the local authorities for such purpose.</p>
                        <p>The company pays tax in Mauritius over its global earnings at an attractive rate of 3% compared to 15% for other resident companies. A GBC is the right type of business entity for holding activities, as well as regulated services requiring license for instance financial services or insurance/re-insurance.</p>

                        <li>The Mauritius Authorized Company</li>
                        <p>This Mauritiusa authorized company can be set up with</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A minimum reinsurance$1</li>
                            <li>One shareholder</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Setting up a Mauritius-authorized company requires a resident registered agent in charge of maintaining records.</p>
                        <p>A Mauritius-authorized company is not considered a resident company for tax purposes and consequently does not have to pay tax on net profits.</p>
                        <p>The Company must however file a return of its income with the Mauritius Revenue Authority.</p>
                        <p>The best uses of for a Mauritius Authorised company is to conduct international trade or as a holding vehicle when access to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) is not a requirement</p>
