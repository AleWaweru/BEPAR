                      <h3>     Curacao Corporate Services </h3>
                    <h4>Introduction </h4>
                        <p>Curaçao is a small island country in the southern Caribbean Sea, north of Venezuela, with the island of Aruba to the west, and tiny Bonaire to the east.
                            Curaçao has done well to develop an economy that draws its capital from investments and combines it with local resources, as well as additional activities that have successfully made this a relatively developed and quality market for the region. The islands main sectors are the oil refinery industry (Venezuelan rigs, tourism, financial services for international companies, and both local and international trade). Thanks to this advanced market, the country is ranked relatively high in terms of production and GDP per capita. In order to diversify their economy, and attract foreign investors, the Curaçao government instates an “open arms” policy for international businesses and entrepreneurs – a fact that makes the incorporation process extremely easy and appealing.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Types of companies </h3>
                        <li><strong>Private Limited Liability Company (BV) </strong>
                            <p>an entity where shareholders operate a corporate entity for themselves and bear the limited liability for the outcomes of its operation. There are no requirements for the company's chartered capital. Any approvals are not required for registering this entity.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Public Limited Liability Company (NV) </strong>
                            <p>an entity that can be created by at least one natural or legal person. The amount of the chartered capital shall be at least AWG 50,000 20% of which has to be paid upfront at the time of incorporation. Still, for certain types of activities, a higher amount of chartered capital may be required. The liability of shareholders is restricted to the amounts of the contributed funds also. The corporate entity is designated for involving additional financial resources and is entitled to offer its shares to the public..</p>
                            <ul>
                                <h4>The differences between the B.V. and the N.V. are:</h4>
                                <li>• The BV has registered shares only;</li>
                                <li>• The Articles of Incorporation can determine that the shareholders can be held liable for the debts of the BV;</li>
                                <li>• The Articles of Incorporation of the BV can contain a different manner for dissolution of the company;</li>
                                <li>• If preferential rights should be attached to shares, such should be provided for in the Articles of Incorporation of the BV;</li>
                                <li>• Delivery of shares of an BV can only take place in the manner as provided for by law;</li>
                                <li>• There is no distinctive financial regime such as for the “large” NV;</li>
                                <li>• Only the BV has the possibility of a company “managed by shareholders”.</li>
                            </ul>


                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Private Fund </h4>
                            <p>– a commercial formation designated to secure the property. It is not allowed to hold entrepreneurship activities for a fund. These vehicles also enjoy favourable tax regimes.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>General Partnership </h4>
                            <p>– a commercial formation where partners hold unlimited liability over the partnership's undertakings. Even the partner’s personal property also can be called to cover potential losses.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Limited Partnership </h4>
                            <p>– – a commercial formation where there can be (i) general partners whose liability is not limited in any way and who actually manage to joint business, and (ii) limited partners whose financial responsibility is limited to the amount of the contributed funds only.</p>
                        </li>



                    </ol>
