                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <h3>Before you register your Singapore company, you’ll need to be aware of these requirements: </h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Your company name needs to be approved before registration</li>
                        <li> You need to appoint a minimum of one resident director. </li>
                        <li>You can have anywhere between 1-50 shareholders, which may or may not be directors. Shareholders can consist of both local and non-local individuals or companies, and 100% non-local shareholding is allowed. </li>
                        <li> You need to appoint a qualified resident company secretary within 6 months of your Singapore company’s registration. Sole directors and/or shareholders cannot act as the company secretary.</li>
                        <li>You need to possess a minimum of S$1 worth of paid-up capital (also known as share capital) to register your Singapore company. This amount can be increased any time after your company is incorporated.</li>
                        <li>You need to provide a local, physical Singapore address as the registered address of the company. The registered address can be either a residential or commercial address, but not a P.O. Box.</li>
                        <li> Singapore-registered companies enjoy attractive tax exemptions and incentives. Your company pays less than 9% for the first S$300,000 you make in annual profits, followed by a flat rate of 17% flat thereafter. Singapore companies do not have to pay capital gains or dividend taxes. For further information on taxes, refer to our Singapore corporate tax guide</li>

                    </ol>

                    <h3>Financial Year End and Annual Returns</h3>
                    <p>A company’s financial year end (FYE) represents the final day of its accounting period. The accounting period is the recognised interval to complete an accounting cycle of the business. The periodicity provides perspective about the profitability of the business on an ongoing basis. Records of transactions are kept over this period and reported in the form of financial statement.

                        Accounting periods can be 12 months or over 52 weeks. If you decide on a 12-month accounting period starting 1 January 2022, your company’s FYE will be 31 December 2022. But if you choose to have a 52-week accounting period starting 1 January 2022, your company’s FYE will be on 30 December 2020.

                        There are statutory obligations under the Companies Act that company directors must comply with or face enforcement action. Annual obligations such as holding annual general meetings and filing annual returns are examples of key statutory requirements.

                        Private companies must file their annual return within 7 months after the financial year end.

                        Filing your company’s annual return on time helps to ensure proper and timely disclosure to all stakeholders. All companies including inactive and dormant companies are required to file annual returns. As long as your company’s status is “live”, you must file its annual return with ACRA even if IRAS has exempted your company from filing its income tax return.

                    <p>All companies must ensure that their registered office is open and accessible to the public for at least three hours during ordinary business hours on each business day. A business day is any day excluding Saturday, Sunday and public holidays.

                        The purpose of this requirement is to allow members of the public to reach out to the office if necessary and to facilitate the delivery of any legal documents. Companies and directors that fail to comply with this requirement may be fined up to S$5,000.

                        The registered office must be an address in Singapore, but it need not be the place of operation.
