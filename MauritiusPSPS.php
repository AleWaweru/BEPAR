                        <h3> Mauritius Payment Intermediary Services License</h3>

                    <h4> Introduction </h4>
                    <p>The Payment Intermediary Services License is of interest to those who wish to operate as an online Payment Service Provider (PSP). The PSP business model is becoming more of a norm in the current business environment to address the ever-increasing need of both online shoppers and online sellers to do business via the internet. The Payment Intermediary Services License can only be applied for under a Category 1 Global Business Company and needs the approval of the Financial Services Commission for a GBC 1 to obtain such a special license. One of the licensing conditions is that the company must maintain an unimpaired capital of at least MUR 500,000 or its equivalent. With a Payment Intermediary Services License, the GBC 1 can offer merchant online services for accepting electronic payments by a variety of payment methods including credit card, bank-based payments such as direct debit, bank transfer, and real-time transfer based on online banking. The main customer base is often composed of online merchant sellers

                                Legally speaking, a minimum of 2 directors are required for GBC 1 holding a special license such as Payment Intermediary Service License. However, the regulator’s and Mauritius Corporate Governance regime require that:
                                a. Such an entity has got a well-balanced board in terms of experience, expertise and governance independence;
                                b. There needs to be fit and proper directors in different areas of running such a regulated Investment Business.
                                Therefore, the 2 local directors required for the GBC 1 regime, almost always will not satisfy the regulator’s criteria. There will need to be an additional minimum 2 directors of different backgrounds, and who are fit and proper with experience in the investment industry.
