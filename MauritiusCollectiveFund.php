                        <h5>Auditor</h5>
                        <p>• A Global Fund is required to have its accounts audited annually by an auditor. <br>
                            • The auditor shall not be an officer of the custodian, the CIS manager or any support functionary of the CIS.</p>

                        <h5>Minimum funding</h5>

                            • Where the minimum amount of subscriptions indicated in the prospectus is not reached during the first six months of the offering period, the funds shall be returned to the investors together with any interest earned thereon, unless the CIS can justify a request for extension and the Commission agrees to such an extension, which shall not exceed a further six months.</p>

                        <h5>Custodian</h5>
                        <p>• CIS shall appoint and shall at all times have a custodian.</p>

                        <h5>Prospectus or offer document</h5>
