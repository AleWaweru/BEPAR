                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>• A certified copy of the constitutional documents of the company (Memorandum and Articles of Association, its charter etc)</li>

                            <p>The Cyprus Company Law changes implemented in 2003 as part of the EU accession process have also affected the rules covering branches. Every foreign corporation that maintains a branch in Cyprus must submit, for every financial year, copies of its financial statements as presented in its last AGM and published in accordance with its country of incorporation. For EU corporations though the law provides some exemptions; they are exempted from submitting separate branch financial statements if they publish their financial statements in their countries of registration and they submit them to the Registrar of Companies.</p>

                            <p>Although the appointment of local board members is not required by law, however, for tax purposes, it is considered desirable. It should be noted that, from a tax point of view, is essential that the company is managed and controlled in Cyprus, which is why it is recommended that the majority of directors are local residents.</p>
